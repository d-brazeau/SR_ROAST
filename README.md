Transcranial alternating current stimulation to modulate alpha activity: a systematic review
===========================

Electric Field simulation using ROAST
-------------------------



### Description ###
This code includes
1. A code to transform MNI coordinates into subject space (voxel) coordinates
2. A code to transform subject space (voxel) coordinates into MNI coordinates
3. A code to assess the focality of the configuration montages obtained with ROAST

Focality is defined as a ratio of the number of brain voxels that have a value greater than 50% of the Emax on the total number of voxels in the cortex. 


### Needed before using the code ###
1. Download [ROAST](https://github.com/andypotatohy/roast)
2. Run your simulation.
